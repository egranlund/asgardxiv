This plugin allows you to implement super security captcha form into web forms.

== Description ==

The Captcha plugin allows you to implement a super security captcha form into web forms. It protects your website from spam by means of math logic, easily understandable by human beings. You will not have to spend your precious time on annoying attempts to understand hard-to-read words, combinations of letters or pictures that make your eyes pop up. All you need is to do one of the three basic maths actions - add, subtract and multiply.
This captcha can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments forms. Also a premium version of the plugin, allowing compatibility with BuddyPress (Registration form, Comments form, "Create a Group" form) and Contact Form 7.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to change a captcha label =

You should go to the Settings page and change the value in the 'CAPTCHA label in the form' field.

= During the settings saving I get the error: 'Please select one point in the blocks "Math actions" and "Complexity Level"'. What is this? =

For stable work of the Captcha plugin you should select at least one item in the 'Math actions' block and select 'Complexity Level' on the Settings page, because math expression should consist of at least 1 math sign and parts of math expression should be displayed like words or numbers or both of them.

= Missing CAPTCHA on the comment form? = 

You might have a theme where comments.php is not coded properly. 

Wopdpress version matters. 

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. 
Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the code line `do_action('comment_form'`... inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` (please check the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= How to use the other language files with CAPTCHA? = 

Here is an example for German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set a WordPress version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` you should enter `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` are present in the plugin (the folder "Languages" in the plugin root).

3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in both files).

4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file using this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.

= I would like to add Captcha Pro to the Contact Form 7. How can I do this? =

1. Make sure you enabled “Contact Form 7″ on the Captcha settings page.
2. Go to “Contact Form 7″ form where you want to make use of Captcha.
3. Find a dropdown menu with the form fields, select BWS CAPTCHA and insert it into your form.

= I would like to add Captcha Pro to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Captcha Pro plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add captcha to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the captcha output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

`if( function_exists( 'cptchpr_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptchpr_display_captcha_custom() } ;`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptchpr_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptchpr_display_captcha_custom(); } ?>`

5. Then you should add the lines to the function of the entered data checking  

`if( function_exists( 'cptchpr_check_custom_form' ) && cptchpr_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`
or
`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptchpr_check_custom_form' ) && cptchpr_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA." ?>`
You could add this line to the variable and display this variable in the required place instead of `echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`. If there is a variable (responsible for the errors output) in the check function, this phrase can be added to this variable. If the function returns 'true', it means that you have entered captcha properly. In all other cases the function will return 'false'.
